# DDOS-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Random-Forest-CatBoost-Classifier

Introduction 
Attacks known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) have grown to be a significant problem for businesses and individuals that use the internet for communication and operations. In a DDOS assault, a sizable number of infected computers, commonly referred to as bots, are utilized to overwhelm the capacity of a targeted network or server and make it unavailable to legitimate users. DDOS assaults can have serious repercussions, ranging from brief service interruptions to total network failure and data loss. DDOS assaults are becoming more frequent and sophisticated as the internet continues to expand and change. Traditional security methods, such intrusion detection systems and firewalls, are no longer adequate to thwart these threats. To address this challenge, new and more advanced techniques are needed to detect and mitigate DDOS attacks in real-time.Machine learning has become a potential solution for DDOS detection as well as network security and intrusion detection. In order to find patterns and abnormalities that are suggestive of DDOS assaults, machine learning algorithms can automatically evaluate and learn from vast volumes of data. These algorithms may then be used to categorize incoming network data as either malicious or regular, offering a way to identify and mitigate DDOS assaults early on. In this study, we compare the performance of Naive Bayes, Logistioc Regression, Random Forest, and CatBoost classifier as machine learning models for DDOS detection.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was used to create the models in order to acquire insights into the data, and normalization was then performed to the encoded data in order to enhance the models' functionality. The findings of this work will contribute significantly to our understanding of the potential of machine learning for DDOS detection and will guide the design of improved DDOS detection systems.

Methodology
1. Data Collection: The first step of this project was to gather the data required for the analysis. The data used in this project is publicly available.
2. Data Exploration and Pre-processing: Once the data was collected, it was necessary to explore the data and pre-process it for analysis. This involved checking for missing values, handling any missing values, and normalizing the data. 3.Splitting the Data: To evaluate the performance of the models, the dataset was split into two parts: training and testing. The training data was used to train the models, and the testing data was used to evaluate the performance of the models. 4.Model Selection and Training: Different machine learning algorithms were used for this project: Naive Bayes, Logistioc Regression, Random Forest, and CatBoost classifier . Each algorithm was trained using the training data. 5.Model Evaluation: After the models were trained, their performance was evaluated using the testing data. The evaluation was performed using the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. 6.Model Comparison: Finally, the performance of the models was compared to determine the best-performing algorithm. 7.Repeat with Normalization: The entire process was repeated after normalizing the data to determine if normalization had any impact on the performance of the models.
